# Weather-App-for-Android
Weather app for android. It is still in the initial stage. Contributions are welcome. Please use development branch for contributions.

All the weather apps today are city based and not location based and evdn if they are, locations are not exact. What I mean is, it is possible that its raining at one location in  a city but not at 500 metres away in the same city. This app intents to accomodate this special feature.
