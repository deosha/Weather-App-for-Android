Please use development branch for contributions.\r\n\r\nAll the weather apps today are city based and not location based and even if they are, locations are not exact. What I mean is, it is possible that its raining at one location in  a city but not at 500 meters away in the same city. This app intents to accommodate this special feature. \r\n\r\n",
